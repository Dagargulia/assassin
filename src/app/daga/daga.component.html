        <p>Ubisoft teams create authentic and memorable experiences for our players to have fun, share, and blossom through games, applications, websites, and online services (what we call our “Services”). To let you enjoy our Services, we crafted rules that apply to everything and everyone in our communities: you, other players, and ourselves. You agree to this “Terms of Use” by using the Services and Content defined below.</p>

        <p>The Ubisoft Services include the games, downloadable contents, season passes, and other game software (contained on disc or other physical medium or downloaded or streamed), and other software products and online and mobile services, including their online functions and other features, together with any of their updates and upgrades, the related websites, the Ubisoft Connect platform, and any other Ubisoft platform, the UBISOFT+ subscription service, the live events hosted, the servers, software, and the framework through which they are provided to you, currently or in the future, by UBISOFT ENTERTAINMENT S.A., or any one of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies, including UBISOFT EMEA SAS and UBISOFT LTD. (collectively “Ubisoft” or “we”).</p>

        <h3>1.2 Terms and Acceptance</h3>
        <p>These terms of use (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of such Services ("user" or "you"). By using the Services and Content, you accept and agree to comply with these Terms and any particular age and territorial criteria. Additional terms may be applicable to a specific Service, including, for example, the Terms of Sale of the Ubisoft Store, the End User License Agreement, and code(s) of conduct (“Code of Conduct”). In addition, our Privacy Policy will give you a clear understanding of our use of the personal data we may collect from you during your use of the Services. Please make sure to read all these documents before accessing a Service.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Licensing</h3>
        <p>“Content” means any elements which are part of the Services, including but not limited to in-game items, customization elements, maps, avatars, all gameplay, graphics, music and sounds, text, all messages or items of information, names, themes, objects, scenery, costumes, effects, dialogues, slogans, places, characters, diagrams, concepts, choreographies, videos, audio-visual effects, and domain names. This includes elements created by you and other users, called User Generated Content.</p>

        <p>The Services and Content are licensed to you, not sold. This means we grant you a personal, limited, non-transferable, and revocable right and license to use the Services and access the Content for your entertainment, non-commercial use, subject to your compliance with these Terms.</p>
